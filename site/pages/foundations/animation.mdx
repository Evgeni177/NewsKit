# Animation

Animation are used to create movement and narrative within your product. Animated interface elements don't just attract attention, they enhance user experience and help guide user flow.
They reveal the functionality and process of a user interface much better than static text. Like any other element of good design, UI animations should have a purpose without being too noticeable.

## Easing

Easing controls the velocity of an animation over its duration. It helps determine an animation’s feeling and can aid in matching the appearance of real-world physics. Easing values are plotted as curves…..

| Token         |                      Value                        |
| ------------ | :-------------------------------------------------: |
| animationEaseIn     | cubic-bezier(.5, 0, 1, 1)     |
| animationEaseOut      | cubic-bezier(0, 0, .5, 1)      |
| animationEaseInAndOut   | cubic-bezier(.5, 0, .5, 1)        |

## Duration

Duration is fundamental to animation. Used properly, it helps animations feel responsive and natural.
Determining which timing to use is a matter of context, including the complexity of the action and the distance over which the animation occurs.

| Token         |                      Value                        |
| ------------ | :-------------------------------------------------: |
| animationDuration010     | 100ms     |
| animationDuration020     | 200ms     |
| animationDuration030     | 300ms     |
| animationDuration040     | 400ms     |
| animationDuration050     | 500ms     |
