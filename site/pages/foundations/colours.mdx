# Colours

## Overview

Colour is key to expressing brand and identity but it also plays an important role in conveying specific meaning to a user.
The NewsKit design system applies a flexible approach to colour that allows brands to utilise bespoke palettes in an appropriate
and systematic way while encouraging adherence to accessibility requirements.

Colours are applied to NewsKit components by a set of well-defined rules at both the theme and component level. This helps to establish a visual tone,
indicate interaction and communicate meaning. Importantly, it also allows our brands to maintain their identity and distinctive styles.

## Palettes

The palette is a group of colours that are not tied to a single product but are part of the growing list of colours available for use in the library.
These colours are free to use but should be critically evaluated for the benefit of their use within a design or product.

## Contextual colours

Contextual colours utilise colours from the palettes and apply them to specific function(s) or purpose(s) within the NewsKit design system.
