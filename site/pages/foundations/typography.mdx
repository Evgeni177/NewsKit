# Typography

## Overview

Words are at the heart of our business. Use the type scale and usage guidelines to present your design and content as clearly and efficiently as possible.

## Type scale

A type scale is used to provide consistency, hierarchy and rhythm, ensuring responsivity across devices. Typography sizing is based on our root font size (rem) of 16pt, which is adjusted to provide a harmonious scale.

  alt="typography example"
  aspectWidth="1388"
  aspectHeight="1600"
/>

## Applying the type scale

Keeping consistent and sticking to logical hierarchies ensures that elements in the UI are clear and easily recognisable when scanning the page.

Although the scale should remain consistent, type attributes can use custom values for the typeface, font, case, size, and letter spacing.

## Headlines

In the type scale, headlines span from a range of 1 through 6. Headlines are the largest text on the screen, reserved for short, important text or numerals.

## Subtitles

Subtitles are smaller than headlines. They are typically reserved for medium-emphasis text that is shorter in length.

## Body

Body text comes in three sizes. Itâ€™s typically used for long-form writing as it works well for smaller text sizes.

## Captions

Captions are the smallest font sizes. They are generally used to annotate imagery or to introduce a headline.
