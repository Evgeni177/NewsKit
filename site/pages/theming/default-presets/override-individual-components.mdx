# Override individual components

Each of the components will document the structure of its default preset on their individual document page.  
You can override default presets by passing the new preset as stylePreset, typePreset, paddingPreset, sizePreset or spaceInline/spaceStack.

## Example

Here is an example of overriding the default presets for medium size `button`.

<CodeFromFile path="examples/theming/override-default-presets.tsx" />

In the example above, the `typePreset` will be overridden with `button020` and `stylePreset` will be replaced with `buttonOutlinedPrimary`, leaving the other presets untouched. Following this example, the other fields can overridden in a similar way. <br/>

The rule of thumb is to make sure the structure of the `overrides` object aligns with the object structure in the `default presets`.
Even for more complicated components that contains nested elements, this rule still applies. 

<CodeFromFile path="examples/theming/override-default-presets-nested.tsx" />

In the example above, not only did the style preset, type preset and space of `byline` get overriden, `byline.link.stylePreset`, `byline.link.typePreset`, `byline.divider.stylePreset` and `byline.divider.spaceInline` can also be overridden with new preset values.
