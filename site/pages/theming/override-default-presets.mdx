# Override default presets

Each of the components will document the structure of its default preset on their individual document page.  
Following the same structure, the default presets can be overridden when creating a new theme by using the `themeOverrider`. 

## Example

Let's assume we have the following structure for the `headline` default presets.

<CodeFromFile path="examples/theming/override-default-presets.tsx" />

In the example above the `headline.heading.stylePreset` will be overridden with `buttonSolidPrimary`. Leaving the other presets untouched. Following this example the `typePrests` and the other fields can overridden in a similar way.

The example below demonstrates, that the default presets can be overridden with newly created presets.

<CodeFromFile path="examples/theming/override-default-with-new.tsx" />

The  style preset `buttonTestStyle` is added to the theme when it is created and it can be used to override the `headline.heading.stylePreset`.
