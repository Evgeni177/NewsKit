## ThemeProvider

A ThemeProvider allows the user to provide a theme that is passed to all NewsKit components.
This theme is an object that represents the brand identity. NewsKit provides sensible defaults if the brand chooses to not fully implement a theme of their own. 
Details of this can be found below in the theme section.

<CodeFromFile path="examples/theming/theme-provider.tsx"/>

The theme is also available to any styled component created using the NewsKit styled utility function nested within the ThemeProvider.

<CodeFromFile language="text" path="examples/theming/styled.tsx"/>

ThemeProvider's can also be nested allowing the child to override the parent. Please note that this is a shallow merge of the parent and child theme.

<CodeFromFile path="examples/theming/nested-theme-provider.tsx"/>

## withTheme

The withTheme higher order component allows a developer to access the global theme inside their codebase as long as there is a ThemeProvider 
at the root of the project.

<CodeFromFile path="examples/theming/with-theme.tsx"/>

## Theme

Themes represent the brand's identity. These are objects that house the primitives and tokens used inside the NewsKit components. NewsKit provides 
sensible defaults so the consumer can override as much or as little of the theme as they wish. Currently the NewsKit component library houses 
3 themes. These can be used in conjunction with the ThemeProvider above.

* theSunTheme
* theTimesTheme
* newskitLightTheme

## createTheme

The createTheme utility function allows you to create your own theme to be used by the ThemeProvider. It takes the following arguments:

* `name | String`
* `options | Object`

The options object is made up of the following attributes:

* `baseTheme | Object`
* `colorOverrides | Object`
* `fontOverrides | Object`
* `themeOverrider | Object`

### baseTheme

The base theme provided here is updated with the overrides to create the output theme of the function. If no theme is provided, the default newskit-light theme is used as a base.

### colorOverrides

A map of color key-value pairs that override the base theme values. An example of these values can be found below:

<CodeFromFile path="examples/theming/colors.ts"/>

### fontOverrides

A map of font key-value pairs that override the base theme values. An example of these values can be found below:

<CodeFromFile path="examples/theming/fonts.ts" />

### themeOverrider

The themeOverrider allows you to override specific values after creating the theme. To accomplish this just pass in an object 
of the values you wish to override.


<CodeFromFile path="examples/theming/overrides.ts" />
