# Typography

## Overview

Words are at the heart of our business. Use the type scale and usage guidelines to present your design and content as clearly and efficiently as possible.

## Type scale

A type scale is used to provide consistency, hierarchy and rhythm, ensuring responsivity across devices. Typography sizing is based on our root font size (rem) of 16pt, which is adjusted to provide a harmonious scale.

<LegacyBlock marginBottom="sizing050" maxWidth="760px">
  <Image
    src="/static/examples/typography/typography.png"
    alt="typography example"
    maxWidth="1388"
    maxHeight="1600"
  />
</LegacyBlock>

## Applying the type scale

Keeping consistent and sticking to logical hierarchies ensures that elements in the UI are clear and easily recognisable when scanning the page.

Although the scale should remain consistent, type attributes can use custom values for the typeface, font, case, size, and letter spacing.

## Headlines

In the type scale, headlines range from 1 to 6. Headlines are the largest text on the screen, reserved for short, important text or numerals.
The components for rendering Headlines are `H1`, `H2`, `H3`, `H4`, `H5`, `H6`.

These components can accept overrides for the style and typography presets.
All heading components follow a consistent prop and override structure. The default style presets for these map to from `headlineH1` - `headlineH6`

## Playground

### Headlines

<Playground
  componentName={['H1', 'H2', 'H3', 'H4', 'H5', 'H6']}
  component={[H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6]}
  knobs={[
    {
      name: 'Content',
      propName: 'children',
      value: 'We tell the stories that matter.',
    },
  ]}
/>

## Subtitles

Subtitles are smaller than headlines. They are typically reserved for medium-emphasis text that is shorter in length.

## Body

Body text comes in three sizes. Itâ€™s typically used for long-form writing as it works well for smaller text sizes.
It can be rendered using the P component, shorter for Paragraph.

##### Props

<LegacyBlock marginTop="sizing040">
  <Prop name="dropCap" type="boolean" default="false">
    If set to true the first letter of the Paragraph text will have an unique
    style. Note that children should start with string for the drop cap to
    function correctly. Becoming the drop cap of the paragraph.
  </Prop>
  <Prop name="overrides" type="object">
    If provided, overrides the respective presets for the component and provided elements.
    <Prop name="stylePreset" type="MQ<StylePresetKeys>">

### Body Text

<Playground
  componentName="P"
  component={P}
  knobs={[
    {
      name: 'Drop Cap',
      propName: 'dropCap',
      type: 'boolean',
      value: true,
    },
    {
      name: 'Content',
      propName: 'children',
      value:
        'Telling the stories that matter, seeding ideas and stirring emotion. Capturing moments, meaning and magic. Making sense of the world. On the shoulders of giants, in the thick of it, behind the scenes and fighting the good fight. Long form and rapid-fire, pragmatic and poetic, comical and critical. Being at the biggest events with the biggest names noticing the smallest details, and sticking up for the little guy.',
    },
  ]}
/>

## Captions

Captions are the smallest font sizes. They are generally used to annotate imagery or to introduce a headline.

## Accessibility

The P component, even with a drop cap, is fully accessible. Infact the drop cap and the rest of the paragraph's text will
be read as unique text by the screen reader.
