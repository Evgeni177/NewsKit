# StylePreset

## Overview

Every style preset carries a meaning and purpose. Specific shapes, colours or effects are used to communicate intent or give cues about the interaction.

<LegacyBlock marginBottom="sizing050" maxWidth="760px">
  <Image src="/static/examples/utils/style-preset.png" alt="stylepreset" />
</LegacyBlock>

1. Overlay *will be a separate foundation that can be applied in rare use cases
2. Border
3. Fill (image or solid colour)
4. Shadow


Contained within a shape of:
- Square
- Rounded
- Semi-rounded

A combination of the above can be used at different states, for example a button might not have a shadow until the user hovers over.

In some scenarios you will want to change the look and feel of a component in ways that aren't possible through changing tokens in a theme, this is where style presets come in.
They can be thought of as a subset of CSS used to define look and feel of components. Style presets and their default mapping are defined on a theme, additional style presets can be created as and when needed.

Not all properties will style a given component, you should refer to specific component's to see what's supported.

<CodeFromFile path="examples/utils/style-preset-example.tsx"/>

The base theme defines default style presets for each component for instance

<CodeFromFile path="examples/utils/get-style-preset-from-theme.tsx"/>

These can be overridden in a child theme.

Often we will only want to update a specific instance of a component to style in a different manner, in this scenario we can pass a style preset to a component.
Nearly all visual components will take at least one style preset. It may help to think of this as applying a class to an element in HTML.

<Code>{'<Paragraph stylePreset="interactive040" />'}</Code>

If no style preset is provided, the button will render in the default state. Configuring this is detailed above.

<Code>{'<Paragraph />'}</Code>

In the future some components will take multiple style presets, that apply across multiple child components.
