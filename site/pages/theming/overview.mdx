# Overview

NewsKit currently offers you the ability to theme foundations such as fonts, colours etc. The foundations that are used globally throughout the site populate components that align with your brand identity.
Please note that we currently only offer a light environment theme (dark environment is in the pipeline).

The NewsKit component library uses CSS in JS to achieve atomised naming to prevent naming collisions when used within a consumers 
codebase. One of the features of the NewsKit component library is an easy to use theming system. Here you will find details on how to implement 
theming for your brand.
