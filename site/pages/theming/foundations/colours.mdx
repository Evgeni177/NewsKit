# Colours

## Overview

Colour is key to expressing brand and identity but it also plays an important role in conveying specific meaning to a user.
The NewsKit design system applies a flexible approach to colour that allows brands to utilise bespoke palettes in an appropriate
and systematic way while encouraging adherence to accessibility requirements.

Colours are applied to NewsKit components by a set of well-defined rules at both the theme and component level. This helps to establish a visual tone,
indicate interaction and communicate meaning. Importantly, it also allows our brands to maintain their identity and distinctive styles.

## Palettes

The palette of colours are an extensive selection of all the colours in the brand. They are not linked to a single use but the contextual colour tokens reference/map to these colours.
Itâ€™s recommended that you critically evaluate their use when applying them to an element over using a contextual colour.

## Contextual colours

Contextual colours utilise colours from the palettes and apply them to specific function(s) or purpose(s) within the NewsKit design system. There are three categories of contextual colours: Ink, Interface and Interactive colours.
