# getSSRId()

## Syntax

<Code>{'getSSRId()'}</Code>

## Overview

Retrieve a uniquie ID that is automatically incremented in the format of: `nk-{id}`

For aria and other attributes like htmlFor, we often need to attach identifiers to elements. Making `id` a required prop in our components shifts this burden to our customers but it's nice to try to automatically provide these unique ids when possible.

Generating unique IDs that match across server/client renders is a hard problem that doesn't have any perfect solutions currently [1][1] [2][2]. UUIDs/Math.random will never match, whereas auto-incrementing IDs may work if server and client render exactly the same DOM, so that's what we'll use here. If this is insufficient for users they can apply ids manually.

One other technique that we can use internally is to do a setState in componentDidMount or something similar, so that these ids are only used client-side, but this could of course have perf implications.

## Return value

Returns a string that is a unique and incremented ID in the format of: `nk-{id}`

## Example 1

<CodeFromFile path="examples/utils/get-ssr-id-map.tsx" />

In this example the unique ID provided is used for the key attribute for React.

## Example 2

<CodeFromFile path="examples/utils/get-ssr-id-for.tsx" />

In this example the unique ID provided is used to connect a HTML input field and a label with.
