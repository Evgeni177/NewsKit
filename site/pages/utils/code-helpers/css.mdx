# CSS

NewsKit exports an unmodified version of Emotion's `css` function. The function returns an object containing the computed name and flattened styles. The returned object is understood by emotion at a low level and can be composed with other emotion based styles inside of the css prop, other css calls, or the styled API.

For more information, please refer to the official Emotion decumentations:
 - [String Styles](https://emotion.sh/docs/css-prop#string-styles)
 - [Composition](https://emotion.sh/docs/composition)
