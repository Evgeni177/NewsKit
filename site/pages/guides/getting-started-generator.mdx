# Getting started with  <br/><br/> NewsKit Component Generator 

## Overview
NewsKit has many components and to increase efficiency we have created a generator to scaffold project files.

## Installing

To run the component generator, run the command `yarn generate:component`.

## Using 
When you call the command `yarn generate:component`, you will be prompted to name your component.
Afterwards, it will create a custom component folder within `src`. It will include the component file, index.ts and type.ts.
It will also include a `tests` folder.

This is an example of a scaffolded project file generated for a component called 'example'.

Here is the directory tree of the component 'example':
 <Image src="/static/example-generator-component.png" alt="example generator component image"  width="288" height="254"/>

If you are interested in viewing the generator, you can view it in the folder "./component-generator".
