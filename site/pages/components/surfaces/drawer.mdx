# Drawer

## Overview

A Drawer is a panel that is used for navigation or filtering content. It can contain information and action items that relate to the current page a user is on.

Since a user can interact with a drawer without leaving the current page, tasks can be achieved more efficiently within the same context of the base UI.

### Usage

Drawers are appropriate for five or more information and action items and should be used across breakpoints for a consistent user experience.
