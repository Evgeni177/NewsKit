# Article Standfirst

## Overview

Article Standfirst is an introductory paragraph in an article, which summarises the article content. It is often in larger or bolder type than regular paragraph text and is positioned at the top of the article content under the article headline. This is to attract the userâ€™s attention to read more of the article.

### Usage

No special requirements.


## Props

The standfirst component provides the following props for customisation.
<LegacyBlock marginTop="sizing040">
  <Prop name="stylePreset" type="string" default="articleStandfirst">
    Set the style presets of the button.
  </Prop>
   <Prop name="typePreset" type="string" default="articleStandfirst">
    Set the style presets of the button.
  </Prop>
  <Prop name="as" type="'h1' | 'h2' | 'h3' | 'h4' | 'h5' | 'h6' | 'span'">
    This is a string name with one of the following html elements: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 or span, that the standfirst can be converted to.
    Article Standfirst defaults as a h2 element, but it can be converted to another heading element or span by `as="span"` prop.
  </Prop>
</LegacyBlock>

## Playground

<Playground
  componentName="ArticleStandfirst"
  newskitPath="/article-standfirst"
  component={ArticleStandfirst}
  knobs={[
    {
      name: 'Content',
      propName: 'children',
      value: 'ArticleStandfirst Content',
    },
    {
      name: 'Style Preset',
      propName: 'stylePreset',
      options: [
        {
          label: 'articleStandfirst',
          value: 'articleStandfirst',
          isDefault: true,
        },
      ],
    },
        {
      name: 'Type Preset',
      propName: 'typePreset',
      options: [
        {
          label: 'articleStandfirst',
          value: 'articleStandfirst',
          isDefault: true,
        },
      ],
    },
  ]}
/>

## Rationale

### Styling

The standfirst was designed to be discreet as they are intended to supplement the primary content.

### Accessibility

#### Colour

Text and background colours must have a 3:1 minimum contrast ratio.
Hover states should have clear contrast change or should include a non colour designator.
