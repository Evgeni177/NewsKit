# Article Standfirst

## Overview

The standfirst component is a simple, styled text paragraph used at the top of the article content. A standfirst is a brief introductory summary of an article, typically appearing immediately after the headline and typographically distinct from the rest of the article.

### Usage

No special requirements.

### Theming

The default tag component uses the following style tokens, which can be overridden:

| Theme Token       | Color Primitive |  Color Value                                          |
| ----------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| standfirstText    | inkSubtle          | <TextBoxSwatch themeColor="inkSubtle"/>         |

## Props

The standfirst component provides no props for customisation.

## Playground

<Playground
  componentName="ArticleStandfirst"
  newskitPath="/article-standfirst"
  component={ArticleStandfirst}
  knobs={[
    {
      name: 'Content',
      propName: 'children',
      value: 'ArticleStandfirst Content',
    }
  ]}
/>

## Rationale

### Styling

The standfirst was designed to be discreet as they are intended to supplement the primary content.

### Accessibility

#### Colour

Text and background colours must have a 3:1 minimum contrast ratio.
Hover states should have clear contrast change or should include a non colour designator.
