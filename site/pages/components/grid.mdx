# Grid & Cell

## Overview

### Usage

The Grid and Cell components are used together to construct a visual grid for responsive page layout. The Grid containers children must be Cell components, which can span different widths at each of the 4 breakpoints.

The 4 breakpoints (xs, sm, md, lg) widths are set via the theme, as are the grid settings. The NewsKit light default grid settings are as follows:

| Setting         | Default Value  | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| maxWidth        | 1920           | The maximum width of the Grid container component. The Grid will not grow bigger than 1920px wide.                                                                                                             |
| containerMargin | 16, 16, 24, 24 | The margin either side of the Grid container component. The margin can be different for each breakpoint. By default it is 16px for xs & sm, and 24px for md & lg.                                              |
| columnGutters   | 16, 16, 24, 24 | The spacing between each Cell component column (i.e. left and right). The margin can be different for each breakpoint. By default it is 16px for xs & sm, and 24px for md & lg.                                |
| rowGutters      | 16, 16, 24, 24 | The spacing between each Cell component row (i.e. top and bottom when Cells are wrapped). The margin can be different for each breakpoint. By default it is 16px for xs & sm, and 24px for md & lg.            |
| columns         | 12             | The total columns available to use. Each Cell by default takes up 1 column. If there are more Cells in a Grid than columns, or the Cell components inside a Grid span a total greater than 12, they will wrap. |

## Grid Props

<LegacyBlock marginTop="sizing040">
  <Prop name="children" type="Cell">
    The Cell components must be used as children of the Grid. Using anything other than the Cell components will break the Grid functionality.
  </Prop>
  <Prop name="xsMargin" type="SizingKeys">
    An override for the grid margin sizing at the xs and upwards breakpoint.
  </Prop>
  <Prop name="smMargin" type="SizingKeys">
    An override for the grid margin sizing at the sm and upwards breakpoint.
  </Prop>
  <Prop name="mdMargin" type="SizingKeys">
    An override for the grid margin sizing at the md and upwards breakpoint.
  </Prop>
  <Prop name="lgMargin" type="SizingKeys">
    An override for the grid margin sizing at the lg breakpoint.
  </Prop>
  <Prop name="xsColumnGutter" type="SizingKeys">
    An override for the column gutter sizing at the xs and upwards breakpoint. This applies to all direct children cells, but not the cells in further nested grids.
  </Prop>
  <Prop name="smColumnGutter" type="SizingKeys">
    An override for the column gutter sizing at the sm and upwards breakpoint. This applies to all direct children cells, but not the cells in further nested grids.
  </Prop>
  <Prop name="mdColumnGutter" type="SizingKeys">
    An override for the column gutter sizing at the md and upwards breakpoint. This applies to all direct children cells, but not the cells in further nested grids.
  </Prop>
  <Prop name="lgColumnGutter" type="SizingKeys">
    An override for the column gutter sizing at the lg breakpoint. This applies to all direct children cells, but not the cells in further nested grids.
  </Prop>
  <Prop name="xsRowGutter" type="SizingKeys">
    An override for the row gutter sizing at the xs and upwards breakpoint. This applies to all direct children cells, but not the cells in further nested grids.
  </Prop>
  <Prop name="smRowGutter" type="SizingKeys">
    An override for the row gutter sizing at the sm and upwards breakpoint. This applies to all direct children cells, but not the cells in further nested grids.
  </Prop>
  <Prop name="mdRowGutter" type="SizingKeys">
    An override for the row gutter sizing at the md and upwards breakpoint. This applies to all direct children cells, but not the cells in further nested grids.
  </Prop>
  <Prop name="lgRowGutter" type="SizingKeys">
    An override for the row gutter sizing at the lg breakpoint. This applies to all direct children cells, but not the cells in further nested grids.
  </Prop>
</LegacyBlock>

## Cell Props

<LegacyBlock marginTop="sizing040">
  <Prop name="children" type="React.ReactNode">
    The children of a column are rendered in that column, any supported React
    node is allowed.
  </Prop>

    The amount of columns for Cell to span at the sm and upwards breakpoint.
  </Prop>
  <Prop name="md" type="number" default={1}>
    The amount of columns for Cell to span at the md and upwards breakpoint.
  </Prop>
  <Prop name="lg" type="number" default={1}>
    The amount of columns for Cell to span at the lg breakpoint.
  </Prop>
  <Prop name="xsHidden" type="boolean" default={false}>
    If true, the Cell will be hidden at the xs breakpoint. Unlike other
    breakpoint props this has no effect on other breakpoints.
  </Prop>
  <Prop name="smHidden" type="boolean" default={false}>

    If true, the Cell will be hidden at the md breakpoint. Unlike other
    breakpoint props this has no effect on other breakpoints.
  </Prop>
  <Prop name="lgHidden" type="boolean" default={false}>
    If true, the Cell will be hidden at the lg breakpoint. Unlike other
    breakpoint props this has no effect on other breakpoints.
  </Prop>
  <Prop name="xsOrder" type="number">

    If set, this is the flex order number than will be applied at the sm and
    upwards breakpoint.
