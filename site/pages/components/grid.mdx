# Grid & Cell

## Overview

### Usage

The Grid and Cell components are used together to construct a visual grid for responsive page layout. The Grid containers children must be Cell components, which can span different widths at each of the 5 breakpoints.

The 5 breakpoints (xs, sm, md, lg, xl) widths are set via the theme, as are the grid settings. The NewsKit light default grid settings are as follows:

| Setting         | Default Value  | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| maxWidth        | 1920           | The maximum width of the Grid container component. The Grid will not grow bigger than 1920px wide.                                                                                                             |
| containerMargin | 16, 16, 24, 24 | The margin either side of the Grid container component. The margin can be different for each breakpoint. By default it is 16px for xs & sm, and 24px for lg & xl.                                              |
| columnGutters   | 16, 16, 24, 24 | The spacing between each Cell component column (i.e. left and right). The margin can be different for each breakpoint. By default it is 16px for xs & sm, and 24px for lg & xl.                                |
| rowGutters      | 16, 16, 24, 24 | The spacing between each Cell component row (i.e. top and bottom when Cells are wrapped). The margin can be different for each breakpoint. By default it is 16px for xs & sm, and 24px for lg & xl.            |
| columns         | 12             | The total columns available to use. Each Cell by default takes up 1 column. If there are more Cells in a Grid than columns, or the Cell components inside a Grid span a total greater than 12, they will wrap. |

## Grid Props
