# Card

## Overview

Cards group content that allows users to browse a collection of related items and actions in a modular, easy-to-read way.
There are three main areas to the card component: Media, Content and Action area.

### Usage

Cards are used to display a summary of content and will reveal more details upon interaction.

## Props

<LegacyBlock marginTop="sizing040">
  <Prop name="href" type="string">
    If provided, the Card will render as an anchor with this prop value as the
    href.
  </Prop>
  <Prop name="media" type="ImageProps | React.ComponentType">
    If this parameter is provided as ImageProps, it will render the media as an image. <br />
    If this is provided as a custom React component, it will render the React component directly.
    <Prop name="src" type="string">
      Image file path that is used directly in the 'src' attribute of
      the internal 'img' element.
    </Prop>
    <Prop name="alt" type="string">
      Image description that is used directly in the 'alt' attribute of
      the internal 'img' element.
    </Prop>
    <Prop name="loadingAspectRatio" type="string" default="3:2">
      This is a string interpolation of the aspect ratio of the loading container of the image.
      This is also used to determine the height or width of the image if only one dimension is provided.
      The default loading aspect ratio of media is 3:2, however, a user should be able to pass any ratio to the media.
    </Prop>
  </Prop>
  <Prop name="overrides" type="object">
    If provided, overrides the respective presets for the component and provided elements. Refer to the defaults below for the object structure:
    <CodeFromFile path="examples/default-presets/card.tsx" />
  </Prop>
</LegacyBlock>

## Playground

<Playground
  componentName="Card"
  newskitPath="/card"
  component={props => (
      <Card {...props}/>
  )}
  knobs={[
    {
      name: 'Href',
      propName: 'href',
      type: 'string',
      value: 'http://webstyle.unicomm.fsu.edu/3.2/img/placeholders/ratio-pref-3-2.png',
    },
    {
      name: 'Media',
      propName: 'media',
      value: {
        src: 'http://webstyle.unicomm.fsu.edu/3.2/img/placeholders/ratio-pref-3-2.png',
        alt: 'Card Media',
      },
    },
  ]}
/>

### Styling

### Accessibility
- When creating a tab order for the different parts of the card, remember to put the headline before the image or media so that screen-reader users get the context before the image alt tag.
- Add aria-label prop to allow a user to describe the action that will be performed when the user interacts with the card. By default, this could be the headline text.
- When nesting other components of the card, always follow those components' accessibility guidelines.
