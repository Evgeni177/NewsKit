# Card

## Overview

Cards group content that allows users to browse a collection of related items and actions in a modular, easy-to-read way.
There are three main areas to the card component: Media, Content and Action area.

### Usage

Cards are used to display a summary of content and will reveal more details upon interaction.

### Variants

There are two card variants - card without inset `<Card/>` card with inset `<CardInset/>`

## Props

<LegacyBlock marginTop="sizing040">
  <Prop name="href" type="string">
    If provided, the Card will render as an anchor with this prop value as the
    href.
  </Prop>
  <Prop name="media" type="ImageProps | React.ComponentType">
    If this parameter is provided as ImageProps, it will render the media as an image. <br />
    If this is provided as a custom React component, it will render the React component directly.
    <Prop name="src" type="string">
      Image file path that is used directly in the 'src' attribute of
      the internal 'img' element.
    </Prop>
    <Prop name="alt" type="string">
      Image description that is used directly in the 'alt' attribute of
      the internal 'img' element.
    </Prop>
    <Prop name="loadingAspectRatio" type="string" default="3:2">
      This is a string interpolation of the aspect ratio of the loading container of the image.
      This is also used to determine the height or width of the image if only one dimension is provided.
      The default loading aspect ratio of media is 3:2, however, a user should be able to pass any ratio to the media.
    </Prop>
  </Prop>
  <Prop name="children" type="Exclude<React.ReactNode, 'undefined'>" required>
    This is the body of the Card. A card requires to have at least a heading. Each element of the body content should be wrapped within a <b>Block</b> component
    which is responsible for the spacing between the elements. Refer to the examples below.
  </Prop>

  <Prop name="actions" type="React.ComponentType">
    If provided, the Card will render the React component being passed to the actions. This could be buttons, tags and/or links. 
    The actions section is typically placed at the bottom of the card and would only be clickable if the child components would be.<br />
    If there are multiple items, it is advised to use the Stack component to display the items. Refer to the examples below.<br />
  </Prop>
  <Prop name="overrides" type="object">
    If provided, overrides the respective presets for the component and provided elements. Refer to the defaults below for the object structure:
    <CodeFromDefaultPresets componentName='card' />
  </Prop>
</LegacyBlock>

### Examples

#### Prerequisites
<CodeFromFile path="examples/card/common.tsx" />

#### Card without inset

<CardMediumWithoutInset/>
<CodeFromFile path="examples/card/card-medium-without-inset.tsx" />

#### Card with inset

<CardSmallWithInset/>
<CodeFromFile path="examples/card/card-small-with-inset.tsx" />

### Styling

### Accessibility
- When creating a tab order for the different parts of the card, remember to put the headline before the image or media so that screen-reader users get the context before the image alt tag.
- Add aria-label prop to allow a user to describe the action that will be performed when the user interacts with the card. By default, this could be the headline text.
- When nesting other components of the card, always follow those components' accessibility guidelines.
