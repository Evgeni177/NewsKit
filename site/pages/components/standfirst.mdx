# Standfirst

## Overview

Standfirst is an introductory paragraph in an article, which summarises the article's content. It is often in larger or bolder type than regular paragraph text and is positioned at the top of the article content under the article headline. This is to attract the userâ€™s attention to read more of the article.

### Usage

No special requirements.


## Props

The Standfirst component provides the following props for customisation.
<LegacyBlock marginTop="sizing040">
  <Prop name="children" type="string" required>
    The content of the Standfirst is passed as the child of the component.
  </Prop>
  <Prop name="renderStyledTextAs" type="'h1' | 'h2' | 'h3' | 'h4' | 'h5' | 'h6' | 'span'" default="h2">
    This is a string name with one of the following html elements: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 or span, that the standfirst can be converted to.
    Standfirst defaults as a h2 element, but it can be converted to another heading element or span by `renderStyledTextAs="span"` prop.
  </Prop>
  <Prop name="overrides" type="object">
    If provided, overrides the respective presets for the component and provided elements.
    Refer to the defaults below for the object structure:
    <CodeFromFile path="examples/standfirst/overrides.tsx" />
  </Prop>
</LegacyBlock>

## Playground

<Playground
  componentName="Standfirst"
  newskitPath="/standfirst"
  component={Standfirst}
  knobs={[
    {
      name: 'Content',
      propName: 'children',
      value: 'Standfirst Content',
    },
    {
      name: 'Render Styled Text as',
      propName: 'renderStyledTextAs',
      options: [
        {
          label: 'h1',
          value: 'h1',
        },
        {
          label: 'h2',
          value: undefined,
          isDefault: true,
        },
        {
          label: 'h3',
          value: 'h3',
        },
        {
          label: 'h4',
          value: 'h4',
        },
        {
          label: 'h5',
          value: 'h5',
        },
        {
          label: 'span',
          value: 'span',
        },
      ],
    },
  ]}
/>

## Rationale

### Styling

The Standfirst component was designed to be discreet as they are intended to supplement the primary content.

### Accessibility

#### Colour

Text and background colours must have a 3:1 minimum contrast ratio.
Hover states should have clear contrast change or should include a non colour designator.
