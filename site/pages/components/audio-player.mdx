# Audio Player

## Overview

The Audio Player component is a collection of custom features and elements built around the native `<audio>` element.

### Usage

The Audio Player requires a source stream to be passed in as a prop. This will then be loaded into the internal `<audio>` element for playback.

## Props

<Block $marginTop="sizing05">
  <Prop name="src" type="string" required>
    URL of the audio source to be played.
  </Prop>
  <Prop name="autoplay" type="string">
    <div>
      Even though the feature is supported in most browser but the browser will only follow this setting if:
    </div>
    
    <ul>
      <li>you are on a desktop browser. it will not work on mobile browsers to prevent users from eating into their mobile data allowance</li>
      <li>it can't happen on page load, the user has to interact with the site for it to work: navigating inside an SPA seems to satisfy the browser as there was no page refresh.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div>
      In Summary autoplay will work in some scenarios, this is expected. It's best thought of as a suggestion for the browser: play the audio automatically if it's acceptable from a usability perspective
    </div>
  </Prop>
</Block>
