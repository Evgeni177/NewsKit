# Hooks

## useMediaQueryObject

### Overview

`useMediaQueryObject` hook handles scenarios in which you want to render component based on media query breakpoints.
This hooks also responds to the window resizing and returns the appropriate value for the new window size.

`useMediaQueryObject` returns the value for the current breakpoint from the provided media query object ( `MQ<T>` )

Note: The hook needs `<MediaQueryProvider>` to be added to an ancestor of the component in which it's used.

### Example

A common use case for using `useMediaQueryObject` is when you want to change component property based on media query.
In the example below, the `<Card />` component changes its layout depending on screen the size.

<Code>
  {`const mqLayout = {
    xs: 'vertical',
    sm: 'vertical',
    md: 'horizontal',
    lg: 'horizontal',
    xl: 'horizontal',
}
const layout = useMediaQueryObject(mqLayout);
<Card layout={layout} /> `}
</Code>

Note: In theory `useMediaQueryObject` could be used with any `MQ<T>`, however, we recommend using it only for props that don't accept `MQ<T>` as a value. Most CSS-based props and overrides already support `MQ<T>` objects.
When you create your own components and want to apply responsive behaviour you should try to use <Link href="/utils/get-from-theme">getters</Link> and <Link href="/utils/get-defaults">defaults</Link> functions.

DO NOT DO THIS:

<Code>
  {`const stylePresets = {
    xs: 'dividerPrimary',
    md: 'horizontal',
}
const dividerStylePreset = useMediaQueryObject(stylePresets);
<Divider overrides={{stylePreset: dividerStylePreset}} />`}
</Code>

## useBreakpointKey

### Overview

`useBreakpointKey` has a similar utility as `useMediaQueryObject`, it's intended usage is where you want to know the currently active breakpoint key `xs | sm | md | lg | xl`.

### Example

<Code>
  {`const breakpointKey = useBreakpointKey();
// return XL when screen has width XL ( 1440px and above )`}
</Code>

`<Card />` component use case

<Code>
  {`const breakpointKey = useBreakpointKey();
  const layout == breakpointKey === 'xs || breakpointKey === 'sm' ? 'vertical' : 'horizontal';
<Card layout={layout} />
// the <Card will render verticaly on XS and SM screens and Horizontaly on the rest of breakpoints`}

</Code>
